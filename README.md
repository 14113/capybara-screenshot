capybara-screenshot gem
=======================

Using this gem, whenever a [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) [cucumber](http://cukes.info/) scenario fails, the HTML for the failed page and a screenshot (when using [capybara-webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit)) is saved into /tmp/capybara.

This is a huge help when trying to diagnose a problem in your failing steps as you can view the source code and potentially how the page looked at the time of the failure.

Usage
-----

    gem install capybara-screenshot

or update your Gemfile to include:

    group :test do
      gem 'capybara-screenshot'
    end

That's it!
